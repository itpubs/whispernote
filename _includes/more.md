## Why not use My Clippings.txt? 
I could have. But I really liked the ability to open the highlight on my device's native Kindle app, right from its link in Evernote with the "Read more at location..." link. `My Clippings.txt` is missing a crucial piece of info to do that, the *Amazon Standard Identification Number* ([ASIN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number)). 

Now, I could use a web service to try to find the ASIN and build the link, but that's too much effort when simple scrolling will do. However, you're welcome to do so. Fork me!
