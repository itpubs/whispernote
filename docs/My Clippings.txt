Then, when I reach the point in the story where the character appears, I will simply insert the actual text typed in the narrative as a second part of the character document. Copy and paste may seem the obvious way to do this but Scrivener has a quicker, more cunning route.

Alternatively change those labels and make them handle character Point of View (POV). Say you have three different character POVs in the book. Make labels for each and set them for each scene accordingly. You have a visual reminder of the current POV and, as we’ll see, can manipulate those scenes using that information.

But now my face is almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows. High arching eyebrows, sharp cheekbones, smoldering eyes, deep purple lips. The costume looks deceptively simple at first, just a fitted black jumpsuit that covers me from the neck down. He places a half crown like the one I received as victor on my head, but it’s made of a heavy black metal, not gold. Then he adjusts the light in the room to mimic twilight and presses a button just inside the fabric on my wrist. I look down, fascinated, as my ensemble slowly comes to life, first with a soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orange-red of burning coal. I look as if I have been coated in glowing embers—no, that I am a glowing ember straight from our fireplace. The colors rise and fall, shift and blend, in exactly the way the coals do. “How did you do this?” I say in wonder. “Portia and I spent a lot of hours watching fires,” says Cinna. “Now look at yourself.” He turns me toward a mirror so that I can take in the entire effect. I do not see a girl, or even a woman, but some unearthly being who looks like she might make her home in the volcano that destroyed so many in Haymitch’s Quell. The black crown, which now appears red-hot, casts strange shadows on my dramatically made-up face. Katniss, the girl on fire, has left behind her flickering flames and bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks. She is as deadly as fire itself.

You don’t want the text on these pages to begin at the top of the page. So I’ve just put eight carriage returns above it. This positions everything mid-page which looks a lot better. Finally, you’ll see these are the only two documents in the Binder which have the ‘As-is’ option ticked. By selecting this Scrivener will suppress the page title, preventing it appearing at the top of the screen page, as it will with other sections. I don’t want a title page with ‘title page’ at the top. But when it comes to a section like ‘Understanding the basics’ I definitely do.

Project Search (Ctrl-Option-F Mac) (Ctrl-Shift-G Windows). Allows you to search for text across all your documents, through every scene and chapter. Scrivenings (Command-1 Mac) (Ctrl- 1 Windows). If multiple items are selected in the editor, displays the current editor as a combined manuscript, showing the text of each document as if they were a single file. In other words you see your entire chapter, part or book, not the individual documents though they are denoted by separators. Corkboard (Command-2 Mac) (Ctrl- 2 Windows). Displays the corkboard. You won’t see anything unless you do this with something selected that has child items, scenes within a chapter for example. If it’s just a single scene you’ll see nothing.  Outline (Command-3 Mac) (Ctrl-3 Windows). Displays the outline. Again, if you have no subsidiary items you won’t see anything.  Enter Composition Mode (Mac) Command-Option-F. My preferred writing mode, blanking out everything except the document itself. Use Ctrl-Option-F to access Lion’s full screen mode. Enter Full Screen Windows F11. The Windows equivalent of the Mac Composition Mode.

Displays the word and character count for the draft and for the current binder selection. Manuscript and Session Target (Command-Shift-T Mac) (Ctr-, Window). Displays counters measuring project length against targeted length and session length against target. A useful way of monitoring your progress.  Take Snapshot (Command-5 Mac) (Ctrl-5 Windows). Available when viewing any text or folder document, this command will take a snapshot — a full backup — of the current text. Use it before making major revisions on a scene so you don’t lose the original. Take Snapshot With Title (Shift-Command-5 Mac) (Shift-Ctrl-5 Windows). As above, but will prompt you for a descriptive title prior to taking the snapshot, which will be displayed next to it for future reference in the snapshot table. Split at Selection (Command-K Mac) (Ctrl-K Windows). Split the current document at the cursor. Useful for breaking up scenes that are too long or quickly splitting an imported long document, say from Word. Split with Selection as Title. (Shift-Command-K Mac) (Ctrl- Shift- K Windows). Splits a document as above but will use the selected text as the title of the new split.  Merge (Command-M Mac) (Ctrl-M Windows). The opposite of splitting, this combines selected documents into one.

Taking the fundamental ideas behind Gale’s traps and adapting them into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It’s less about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology behind them. Booby-trapping an area that provides something essential to survival. A water or food supply. Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater destruction. Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the actual desired target, the parent. Luring the victim into what appears to be a safe haven—where death awaits it. At some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind and focused on more human impulses. Like compassion. A bomb explodes. Time is allowed for people to rush to the aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bomb kills them as well.

Later, as the earth's span closed, the transferred minds would again migrate through time and space--to another stopping-place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury. But there would be races after them, clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horror-filled core, before the utter end.

The place can be reached from Pilbarra in about four days by motor tractor--which we'd need for our apparatus. It is somewhat west and south of Warburton's path of 1873, and 100 miles southeast of Joanna Spring. We could float things up the De Grey River instead of starting from Pilbarra--but all that can be talked over later. Roughly the stones lie at a point about 22° 3' 14" South Latitude, 125° 0' 39" East Longitude.

Could I still find the house of the writing master, and the tower where S'gg'ha, the captive mind from the star-headed vegetable carnivores of Antarctica, had chiselled certain pictures on the blank spaces of the walls? Would the passage at the second level down, to the hall of the alien minds, be still unchoked and traversable? In that hall the captive mind of an incredible entity--a half-plastic denizen of the hollow interior of an unknown trans-Plutonian planet eighteen million years in the future--had kept a certain thing which it had modelled from clay.

The records, written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose fabric were bound into books that opened from the top, and were kept in individual cases of a strange, extremely light, rustless metal of greyish hue, decorated with mathematical designs and bearing the title in the Great Race's curvilinear hieroglyphs. These cases were stored in tiers of rectangular vaults--like closed, locked shelves--wrought of the same rustless metal and fastened by knobs with intricate turnings.

[The banshee (from ban [bean], a woman, and shee [sidhe], a fairy) is an attendant fairy that follows the old families, and none but them, and wails before a death. Many have seen her as she goes wailing and clapping her hands. The keen [caoine], the funeral cry of the peasantry, is said to be an imitation of her cry. When more than one banshee is present, and they wail and sing in chorus, it is for the death of some holy or great one.

Wild and strange was that entrance, the whole of which appeared formed of grim and grotesque faces, blending so strangely each with the other that it was impossible to define any: the chin of one formed the nose of another; what appeared to be a fixed and stern eye, if dwelt upon, changed to a gaping mouth; and the lines of the lofty forehead grew into a majestic and flowing beard. The more Robin allowed himself to contemplate the forms around him, the more terrific they became; and the stoney expression of this crowd of faces assumed a savage ferocity as his imagination converted feature after feature into a different shape and character.
