# Rationale 

- You can save [your Kindle highlights](https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights "https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights") as *one long note* with **Evernote Web Clipper**, but [Evernote can't split a note into multiple notes](http://discussion.evernote.com/topic/21855-splitting-a-note-into-multiple-notes/, "Evernote Discussion Forum"), and you really want to save each highlight *separately*. 
- You can save each highlight into a separate note with **Evernote Web Clipper**, but that's too tedious. 

# FAQs

Why this solution?

- Open the note that you're reviewing and read it in context right on Kindle. Each note that is created has a hyperlink that opens your native Kindle app so you can read right there and view its context.
